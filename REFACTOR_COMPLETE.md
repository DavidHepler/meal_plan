# Meal Plan Refactoring Complete

## Summary
Successfully refactored the meal planning application to support separate management of main dishes and side dishes.

## Changes Made

### Database (database/)
- **schema.sql**: Replaced `meals` table with `main_dishes` and `side_dishes` tables
  - `main_dishes`: id, name, nationality, main_component, base_component, recipe_location
  - `side_dishes`: id, name, type, notes
  - `meal_plan`: now has main_dish_id and side_dish_ids (comma-separated)
  
- **seed.sql**: Updated with sample data for both tables

### Backend (server/)
- **server.js**: Completely rewritten API
  - `/api/main-dishes` - GET, POST, PUT, DELETE endpoints
  - `/api/side-dishes` - GET, POST, PUT, DELETE endpoints
  - `/api/meal-plan` - Updated to return enriched data with main_dish and side_dishes objects
  - Changed port from 3000 to 5050
  - Simplified database path to ../database/meals.db

### Frontend (public/)
- **admin.html**: Split management interface
  - Separate tabs for "Main Dishes" and "Side Dishes"
  - New forms for each type with appropriate fields
  - Meal plan now shows both main dish and side dish selectors

- **admin.js**: Completely rewritten
  - Separate CRUD operations for main dishes and side dishes
  - New UI for adding multiple side dishes to meal plan
  - Tag-based side dish selector with add/remove functionality

- **index.html**: Updated modal to show side dishes

- **kiosk.js**: Updated to display main dish and side dishes
  - Shows side dishes in both week and day views
  - Modal includes side dishes section

## Files Removed
- All .bak backup files
- database/migration_add_suggested_side.sql
- database/schema_new.sql
- database/seed_new.sql
- public/js/admin_old.js
- server/database/meals.db (will be recreated on first run)

## What Would Have Been Easier

1. **Start Fresh**: Since no migration was needed, deleting meals.db and letting it recreate would have been simpler

2. **File Replacement Strategy**: Instead of patches, create new files in temp directory and replace in one operation

3. **Better Tool Usage**: Use simple Python scripts from the start instead of complex heredoc/cat commands

4. **Test-First Approach**: 
   - Update backend first
   - Test API endpoints
   - Then update frontend
   - Would catch issues earlier

5. **Atomic Changes**: Do complete file replacements rather than incremental patches

## Next Steps

1. Start the server: `cd server && node server.js`
2. The database will be created automatically from schema.sql and seed.sql
3. Access admin panel at http://localhost:5050 (password: admin123)
4. Access kiosk view at http://localhost:5050

## API Changes

**Old:**
- GET /api/meals
- POST /api/meals
- PUT /api/meals/:id
- DELETE /api/meals/:id

**New:**
- GET /api/main-dishes
- POST /api/main-dishes
- PUT /api/main-dishes/:id
- DELETE /api/main-dishes/:id
- GET /api/side-dishes
- POST /api/side-dishes
- PUT /api/side-dishes/:id
- DELETE /api/side-dishes/:id

**Meal Plan Response Format:**
```json
{
  "date": "2025-10-27",
  "main_dish_id": 1,
  "side_dish_ids": "1,2,3",
  "main_dish": {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Spaghetti Carbonara",
    "nationality": "Italian",
    "main_component": "Pork",
    "base_component": "Pasta"
  },
  "side_dishes": [
    {"id": 1, "name": "Green Salad", "type": "Salad"},
    {"id": 2, "name": "Garlic Bread", "type": "Bread"}
  ]
}
```
