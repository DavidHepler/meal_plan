```

### Making Changes

1. **Update the code** in the appropriate files
2. **Rebuild containers**
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose up -d --build
   ```

### Viewing Logs
```bash
# All services
docker-compose logs -f

# Specific service
docker-compose logs -f server
docker-compose logs -f web
```

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Image Upload**: Upload and display meal images
  - Images stored in filesystem via Docker volume
  - Upload endpoint already implemented in server
  - UI for image upload needs to be added
  
### Potential Improvements
- Multiple user accounts with different permissions
- Meal categories and filtering
- Recipe import from URLs
- Shopping list generation
- Meal rotation suggestions
- Mobile app version
- Print-friendly meal plans

## Troubleshooting

### Database not initializing
```bash
docker-compose down -v  # Remove volumes
docker-compose up -d --build
```

### Permission issues
Ensure the database directory has proper permissions:
```bash
chmod -R 755 database/
```

### Cannot access application
- Ensure ports 5040 and 5050 are not in use
- Check Docker containers are running: `docker-compose ps`
- Check logs: `docker-compose logs`
