# Automatic Meal Archiving Implementation

## Summary
Implemented automatic archiving of past meals to the meal history database. Meals are now automatically archived without requiring manual intervention through the "Archive Past Meals" button.

## Changes Made

### 1. Server-Side Changes (`server/server.js`)

#### Added Auto-Archive Helper Function
- Created `autoArchivePastMeals()` function that automatically archives all past meals (before today) to the history table
- Archives only meals that haven't already been archived (prevents duplicates)
- Logs the number of meals archived for monitoring

#### Three-Tier Automatic Archiving Strategy

1. **On Server Startup**
   - Runs auto-archive 2 seconds after server starts
   - Ensures any past meals are captured when server restarts

2. **Daily Scheduled Archive**
   - Automatically runs every day at 2:00 AM
   - Uses a self-scheduling mechanism that reschedules itself after each run
   - Logs the next scheduled archive time

3. **On Meal Plan Updates**
   - Runs auto-archive whenever a meal plan entry is updated or created
   - Ensures real-time archiving as meals become past dates
   - Triggered through the PUT `/api/meal-plan/:date` endpoint

### 2. Frontend Changes

#### Admin HTML (`public/admin.html`)
- Added visual indicator showing "âœ“ Auto-archiving enabled" in the History section
- Updated button text from "Archive Past Meals" to "Archive Past Meals Now" to clarify it's manual override
- Added informational text explaining when auto-archiving occurs

#### Admin JavaScript (`public/js/admin.js`)
- Updated `archivePastMeals()` function confirmation message to inform users that archiving is automatic
- Enhanced feedback to show "No new meals to archive" when all meals are already archived

#### Admin CSS (`public/css/admin.css`)
- Added `.auto-archive-indicator` styling with green badge design
- Added `.info-text` styling for explanatory text
- Enhanced `.section-header` to properly layout the indicator and button

## How It Works

### Archiving Process
1. The system checks for meals in `meal_plan` table where the date is before today
2. For each past meal that hasn't been archived yet, it creates an entry in `meal_history` with:
   - Date
   - Meal ID
   - Meal name
   - Timestamp
3. The meal remains in the `meal_plan` table (visible in 2-week view)
4. Duplicate prevention: Won't archive the same meal/date combination twice

### Benefits
- **Zero Maintenance**: No need to manually click "Archive Past Meals"
- **Real-time**: Meals are archived as soon as they're saved or the day passes
- **Reliable**: Multiple trigger points ensure nothing is missed
- **Safe**: Built-in duplicate prevention
- **Transparent**: Users can still manually trigger archiving if desired

## Database Structure
The existing `meal_history` table structure remains unchanged:
- `id`: Primary key
- `date`: Date the meal was scheduled
- `meal_id`: Reference to the meal
- `meal_name`: Snapshot of meal name at time of archiving
- `comment`: Optional user comments (can still be added manually)
- `created_at`: Timestamp of when archived

## User Experience
- Users can continue using the meal plan as before
- The history view now automatically populates without manual intervention
- Manual archiving button remains available if users want to force an immediate archive
- Clear visual feedback showing auto-archiving is active

## Testing Recommendations
1. Add some meals to dates in the past
2. Save the meal plan or wait for the scheduled run
3. Check the History section to verify meals appear
4. Restart the server and verify startup archiving works
5. Check server logs for archiving messages
